        <h2>Stay Fit While Living Fast in the City</h2>
        <p>Living a fast-paced life in the city can sometimes make it challenging to maintain a healthy diet. Here's how you can eat clean and stay energized:</p>

        <h3>1. Breakfast: Power Up with Protein</h3>
        <p>Start your day with a protein-packed breakfast. Scrambled eggs, oatmeal with nuts, or a protein shake are great options to keep you fueled.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Lunch: Balanced & Nutritious</h3>
        <p>Choose lean protein like chicken or tofu, along with a mix of vegetables and complex carbs like quinoa or brown rice for lunch.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Snack: Grab & Go</h3>
        <p>Keep healthy snacks on hand, such as fruits, nuts, or a small smoothie, to prevent hunger between meals.</p>

        <h3>4. Dinner: Light & Fresh</h3>
        <p>Keep dinner light and fresh with a protein source (like fish) and a large salad with olive oil dressing. Avoid heavy meals late at night.</p>

        <h3>5. Hydration: Keep Water Close</h3>
        <p>Drinking plenty of water throughout the day helps to stay hydrated, improve metabolism, and control hunger.</p>

        <p>By following these diet tips, you'll be able to maintain your fitness levels, even in the fast-paced urban environment!</p>
