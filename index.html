        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Being a child of a man who's served in the military, it was always very active whenever my father used to come home. He would make us work out, and it became part of my lifestyle...</p>
        <p>...At the age of 17, I weighed 48kg and felt underconfident. I couldn’t talk to people when these big college guys bullied me. That’s when I decided to change my life. I joined a gym and worked on myself. Waking up at 5 am every day to work out, cook my meals, study, and repeat was not easy, but I stuck to it. Eventually, I transformed my body, gained confidence, and got in the best shape of my life...</p>
        <p>...That’s when I decided to pursue a career in fitness, so I could help others transform their lives. It’s not just about looking good, it’s about feeling good and confident inside out. My journey led me to pursue ACE certification, which laid the foundation for my fitness career...</p>
        <p>Now, I am here to help you become the best version of yourself!</p>
